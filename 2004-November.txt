Subject: [Spew-devel] [Bug #2760] Usage error messages could be more helpful
Message-ID: <200411092053.iA9Kr4mt016768@unicorn.berlios.de>

Bug #2760, was updated on 2004-Nov-09 13:53
Here is a current snapshot of the bug.

Project: spew
Category: Functionality
Status: Open
Resolution: None
Bug Group: None
Priority: 1
Submitted by: apers
Assigned to : none
Summary: Usage error messages could be more helpful

Details: Some of the error messages spit out when parsing command-line options could be more helpful:

1.  when transfer size in inadvertanly ommited, you get the following message:

   spew: Could not parse size.

A better messages indicating that the paramter is missing would be better. Also a usage statement should be spit out.

2.  When not giving a block size with the -d|--direct-io option, you get
the following message:
  
    spew: MIN_BUFFER_SIZE must be a multiple of 1024 bytes when using direct I/O.

A better message would indicate that you must use the -b option to 
set the block size to 1024 (or greater).

If would be helpful to have an option to offset the
buffer a certain amount of bytes either using a fixed
or a random amount.   This would aid system and driver
testing on OS's like HP-UX that don't always align
buffer head data on block boundaries.  Example:

--buffer-offset=OFFSET

or to mirror the max-buffer-size/min-buffer-size options:

--min-buffer-offset=OFFSET --max-buffer-offset=OFFSET
