Message-ID: <200505092326.j49NQkb9020420@unicorn.berlios.de>

Summary: Read IOPS statistic calculated incorrectly

Details: The calculation for read IOPS is incorrect.  It is dividing read operations by write transfer time instead of read transfer time.  This results in a divide by zero when using the --raw operation, e.g.,

Total iterations:                                2
Total runtime:                            00:00:05
Total read transfer time (RTT):           00:00:00
Total read transfer rate (RTR):         8.14 MiB/s
Total read IOPS:                         inf IOPS

and duplicated figures when using the --raw operation, e.g.,

Total iterations:                                2
Total runtime:                            00:00:05
Total write transfer time (WTT):          00:00:00
Total write transfer rate (WTR):        7.83 MiB/s
Total write IOPS:                    8020.05 IOPS
Total read transfer time (RTT):           00:00:00
Total read transfer rate (RTR):         8.11 MiB/s
Total read IOPS:                     8020.05 IOPS

Comment:
Use correct formula to calculate read IOP's.
