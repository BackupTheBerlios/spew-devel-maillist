Subject: [Spew-devel] [Bug #12427] File completely overwritten when using
	---offset option
Message-ID: <200711131857.lADIvPOc008981@unicorn.berlios.de>

Bug #12427, was updated on 2007-Nov-13 11:57
Here is a current snapshot of the bug.

Project: spew
Category: Functionality
Status: Open
Resolution: None
Bug Group: None
Priority: 5
Submitted by: apers

Summary: File completely overwritten when using ---offset option

Details: When using spew --write or --raw on an existing file with the -o|--offset option, the file is completely overwritten.  Data before the offset is set to 0 and the file is truncated to offset plus transfer size. The expected behavior is that just the offset + transfer size should be overwritten, not the entire file.

Comment:
This behavior is caused by the use of the O_TRUNC flag on open.  It should not be set when using an offset != 0.
