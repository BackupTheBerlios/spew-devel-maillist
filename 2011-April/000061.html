<PRE>Hi list,

Low volume list, but a nice little package.  It should get more love.  I
just introduced it as part of Gentoo's portage so our users can enjoy.

Since gentoo is a from source distro, our packaging system allows the
user to choose how binaries will be built.  Spew has no problems
building/running when it is dynamically linked, but static linking is
problematic.  You hit it when spew is statically linked against a
gpm-enabled ncurses.  ncurses dlopen's the gpm libraries and so they are
still needed at runtime --- classic issue between dlopen/static linking.

I resolved the problem by making the gentoo dependency reflect the fact
that, if you want static linking, then your ncurses must not have gpm
support.  This is part of the problem behind this discussion:

<A HREF="http://developer.berlios.de/forum/forum.php?forum_id=7361">http://developer.berlios.de/forum/forum.php?forum_id=7361</A>

Gentoo can at least reflect this complex dependency, but on binary based
distros which try to compile every available feature, you'll be in
trouble with your static spew.  So this issue is more for upstream if
they wish better porting to those distros.

Resolutions:

1) drop static option in spew altogether

2) hack up configure.ac to check if ncurses has gpm support, don't
present the static option when it does

3) patch against ncurses to link without using dlopen


I'd be willing to submit patches, but let's see what the feeling is
about this issue first.
