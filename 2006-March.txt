Subject: [Spew-devel] Patch to add additional patterns
Message-ID: <E1FHivo-0002Xo-0q@host01.ipowerweb.com>

A while back I was using spew to help track down a data corruption
problem so I needed a few more recognizable patterns to track several
processes.

I ended up converting the zeros class into a more generic bytepatterns
into its own class.  The patch against trunk is attached.

Looks like a very useful contribution.  I'll apply this or something 
very similar to the next release.  The trunk branch is kind of in 
maintenance mode, but if I find a critical bug requiring a new release 
there, I will add it then.  I am getting close the releasing a threaded 
version, so it will definitely be applied there.

Thanks for the help.

Andrew
