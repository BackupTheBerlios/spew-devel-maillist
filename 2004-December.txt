Subject: [Spew-devel] [Bug #2707] configure libncurses check broken for Debian/stable
Message-ID: <200412030104.iB314Jji024613@unicorn.berlios.de>

Bug #2707, was updated on 2004-Oct-29 13:48

Summary: configure libncurses check broken for Debian/stable

Details: The configure script checks for the call is_term_resized() to determine 
whether nurses5 is installed.  Apparently this call is only available in later versions of ncurses.  In particular, it is not in the 5.2.2 release shipped in Debian/woody,
so configuration fails with:

checking for is_term_resized in -lncurses... no
configure: error: PACKAGE requires ncurses

when run.  Need to find a more common function that is available in ncurses, but
not available in curses.  Beware of bastardized mixed curses/ncurses installation
in HP-UX.


Follow-Ups:

Comment:
Use wresize() call in configure.ac to determine whether ncurses is available rather than is_term_resized().

Revision 13.

Summary: Usage error messages could be more helpful

Details: Some of the error messages spit out when parsing command-line options could be more helpful:

1.  when transfer size in inadvertanly ommited, you get the following message:

   spew: Could not parse size.

A better messages indicating that the paramter is missing would be better. Also a usage statement should be spit out.

2.  When not giving a block size with the -d|--direct-io option, you get
the following message:
  
    spew: MIN_BUFFER_SIZE must be a multiple of 1024 bytes when using direct I/O.

A better message would indicate that you must use the -b option to 
set the block size to 1024 (or greater).

Use a config file, e.g., $HOME/.spewrc to read in and
use common options,  like --units.  It can be annoying
to have to specify these when you commonlly use
somthing other than
the default values.

If would be helpful to have an option to offset the
buffer a certain amount of bytes either using a fixed
or a random amount.   This would aid system and driver
testing on OS's like HP-UX that don't always align
buffer head data on block boundaries.  Example:

--buffer-offset=OFFSET

or to mirror the max-buffer-size/min-buffer-size options:

--min-buffer-offset=OFFSET --max-buffer-offset=OFFSET

Comment:
Fixed in revision 17.

Now issue the following message if TRANSFER_SIZE and/or FILE arguments are ommitted from the comand-line:

    spew: Need TRANSFER_SIZE and FILE.

a usage message is also emitted.

Now issue the following message if an invalid argument is 
used for -b|--min-block-size along with the -d|--direct-io option:

   spew: MIN_BUFFER_SIZE must be a multiple of 1024  bytes when  using direct I/O. Use -b|--min-buffer-size to set MIN_BUFFER_SIZE.
